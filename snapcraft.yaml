summary: An app that helps users learn more about Bash!
description: |
  An app that assists users with (almost) every command in Bash.
  It adapts to the user's skill level:
  - Beginner: Can install apps and use basic commands.
  - Medium: Can create scripts but needs improvement in certain areas.
  - Expert: Knows everything about Bash.
  
  But if someone has a problem and just doesn't want to learn:
  - There is going to be a long list of the most common errors.
  - The long list will also have more hard issues.
