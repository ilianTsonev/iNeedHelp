iNeedHelp is gonna be a snap for the best of intentions!
It `(may or may not)` have:
  -A list of question where if someone wants help with specific thing he will find it in the longlist
  -Easy way to learn how to use the bash correctly `(Example: instead of $sudo apt install [insert apt here] #it installs and then $sudo apt install [insert another apt here)`
  -Some other functions
